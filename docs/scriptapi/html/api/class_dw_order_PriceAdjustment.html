 ProductLineItem, ShippingLineItem, ProductShippingLineItem, or a LineItemCtnr, and are generally categorized as
 product-level, shipping-level, or order-level. PriceAdjustments are generated by the B2C Commerce promotions engine
 when applying discounts. See <a href="class_dw_campaign_PromotionMgr.html#dw_campaign_PromotionMgr_applyDiscounts_DiscountPlan_DetailAnchor">PromotionMgr.applyDiscounts(DiscountPlan)</a>. They may also be
 generated by custom code through the API. See for example
 <a href="class_dw_order_ProductLineItem.html#dw_order_ProductLineItem_createPriceAdjustment_String_DetailAnchor">ProductLineItem.createPriceAdjustment(String)</a>. In the latter case, the PriceAdjustment is called
 "custom"; in the former case, it is called "system". System price adjustments are associated with the promotion that
 triggered their creation. If the promotion was coupon-based, then the price adjustment will additionally be
 associated with a coupon line item in the LineItemCtnr.</div>

 adjustment is "related" (in the sense defined below) and the portion of
 this adjustment's price which applies to each after discount prorating is
 performed. This information is sometimes useful to display in the
 storefront but is more often useful for integrating with backend
 order-management and accounting systems which require all discounts to be
 itemized.
 <p/>
 The definition of "related" product line items depends on the type of
 promotion which generated this price adjustment:

 <ul>
 <li>For order promotions, price adjustments are prorated across all
 product line items which are not explicitly excluded by the promotion.
 Custom order price adjustments apply to all items in the LineItemCtnr.</li>
 <li>For Buy-X-Get-Y product promotions, price adjustments are prorated
 across all items all product line items that are involved in the
 promotion, meaning that the PLI has one or more items contributing to the
 qualifying product count (i.e. the item is one of the X) or receiving the
 discount (i.e. the item is one of the Y).</li>
 <li>Other product promotions are not prorated and simply adjust the
 parent product line item, and so the returned map is of size 1.</li>
 <li>For shipping promotions, this method returns an empty map.</li>
 </ul>

 Buy-X-Get-Y product promotions are prorated as follows: Each price
 adjustment generated by the promotion is sequentially prorated upon the
 related items according to the items' adjusted prices after all non-BOGO
 product promotions are considered, but before order promotions are
 considered.
 <p/>
 Order promotions are prorated sequentially upon non-excluded items
 according to the order in which they applied during promotion processing.
 <p/>
 The values in the map are inclusive of tax if this price adjustment is
 based on gross pricing, and exclusive of tax otherwise. The sum of the
 prorated prices always equals the price of this price adjustment.</div>

 value represents the number of units of the parent product line item to
 which the adjustment applies. Because promotions may have a maximum
 number of applications this value may be less than the product line item
 quantity.

 this method always returns 0.</div>

 adjustment is "related" (in the sense defined below) and the portion of
 this adjustment's price which applies to each after discount prorating is
 performed. This information is sometimes useful to display in the
 storefront but is more often useful for integrating with backend
 order-management and accounting systems which require all discounts to be
 itemized.
 <p/>
 The definition of "related" product line items depends on the type of
 promotion which generated this price adjustment:

 <ul>
 <li>For order promotions, price adjustments are prorated across all
 product line items which are not explicitly excluded by the promotion.
 Custom order price adjustments apply to all items in the LineItemCtnr.</li>
 <li>For Buy-X-Get-Y product promotions, price adjustments are prorated
 across all items all product line items that are involved in the
 promotion, meaning that the PLI has one or more items contributing to the
 qualifying product count (i.e. the item is one of the X) or receiving the
 discount (i.e. the item is one of the Y).</li>
 <li>Other product promotions are not prorated and simply adjust the
 parent product line item, and so the returned map is of size 1.</li>
 <li>For shipping promotions, this method returns an empty map.</li>
 </ul>

 Buy-X-Get-Y product promotions are prorated as follows: Each price
 adjustment generated by the promotion is sequentially prorated upon the
 related items according to the items' adjusted prices after all non-BOGO
 product promotions are considered, but before order promotions are
 considered.
 <p/>
 Order promotions are prorated sequentially upon non-excluded items
 according to the order in which they applied during promotion processing.
 <p/>
 The values in the map are inclusive of tax if this price adjustment is
 based on gross pricing, and exclusive of tax otherwise. The sum of the
 prorated prices always equals the price of this price adjustment.</div>
