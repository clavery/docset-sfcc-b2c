                    <div class="description">ProductPriceModel provides methods to access all the
 <a href="class_dw_catalog_PriceBook.html">PriceBook</a> information of a product. A ProductPriceModel
 instance is retrieved by calling <a href="class_dw_catalog_Product.html#dw_catalog_Product_getPriceModel_DetailAnchor">Product.getPriceModel()</a>
 or <a href="class_dw_catalog_Product.html#dw_catalog_Product_getPriceModel_ProductOptionModel_DetailAnchor">Product.getPriceModel(ProductOptionModel)</a> for a
 specific product. The latter method will return a model which also includes
 the additional option prices of an option product.
 <p/>
 When the current price of a product is accessed in the storefront via its
 price model, a price lookup is performed. The high-level steps of this price
 lookup are:

 <ul>
 <li>Get all price books applicable in the context of the current site, time,
 session, customer, source code.</li>
 <li>Identify all prices in the applicable price books and for a requested
 quantity.</li>
 <li>Calculate the best-price of all identified prices. The best-price is the
 lowest price.</li>
 </ul>

 In more detail:
 <p/>

 <b>Identify applicable price books</b><br/>
 <ul>
 <li>If any price books are explicitly registered in the session (see pipelet
 SetApplicablePriceBooks), use these price books and their direct parents for
 price lookup. Ignore all inactive price books, price books not valid at the
 current time, and price books with a currency other than the session currency.</li>
 </ul>

 <b>Otherwise:</b><br/>
 <ul>
 <li>If a valid source code is registered with the current session, get all
 price books assigned to the source code and their parent price books. Ignore
 all inactive price books, price books not valid at the current time, and
 price books with a currency other than the session currency.</li>
 <li>Get all price books assigned to site and their parent price books. Ignore
 all inactive price books, price books not valid at the current time, and
 price books with a currency other than the session currency.</li>
 </ul>

 <b>Identify all prices:</b><br/>
 <ul>
 <li>Get all price definitions for the product from all applicable price
 books. Ignore price definitions not valid at the current time.</li>
 <li>Convert any percentage price definition into a monetary amount. As the
 base price for this calculation, the minimum product price for the minimum
 order quantity of the product, including product options, is used.</li>
 <li>Compare all prices and identify the lowest (= best) price.</li>
 <li>Calculate best price for each defined price cut in the price table and
 return price table.</li>
 </ul>

 <b>Variation Price Fallback:</b><br/>
 <ul>
 <li>If no applicable pricebooks for a variant is found, the price lookup gets
 the price books from the variant's master product</li>
 <li>A price books is also not applicable of the price definition for the
 variant in the price book is not valid at the current time.</li>
 </ul>

 <p/>

 Typically, in order to do a standard price lookup, it is only necessary to
 call <code>Product.getPriceModel().getPrice()</code>. However, Commerce Cloud
 Digital also supports tiered prices, meaning that higher quantities receive
 a lower price. In this case, the merchant typically wants to display a table
 of price points on product detail pages. Therefore, the ProductPriceModel
 provides the method <a href="class_dw_catalog_ProductPriceModel.html#dw_catalog_ProductPriceModel_getPriceTable_DetailAnchor">getPriceTable()</a> to retrieve a table of these prices.

 <p/>

 If a merchant wants to know not only what the price of a given product is,
 but what price book the price was derived from, this class provides the
 method <a href="class_dw_catalog_ProductPriceModel.html#dw_catalog_ProductPriceModel_getPriceInfo_DetailAnchor">getPriceInfo()</a>. This class also provides methods to lookup
 product prices in specific price books by name and quantity. See
 <a href="class_dw_catalog_ProductPriceModel.html#dw_catalog_ProductPriceModel_getPriceBookPrice_String_DetailAnchor">getPriceBookPrice(String)</a>.</div>
